Steps to produce data consumable by the program from file data.js (currently in
src/js/store/data.js):

$ node flow-algo.js > data.txt

(If necessary)
quote your string in data.txt file, so that it becomes a single argument:
	$ ~/compSc/quoteStr.sh [file]

Output in file can now be consumed in the program
